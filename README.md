# First Personal Project Ever
Welcome to my very first personal project! ðŸŽ‰

In this project, I've explored the basics of Python by creating a few handy utilities:

Calculator: A simple yet functional calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
Random Password Generator: Generates strong, random passwords to keep your accounts secure.
To-Do List: A basic to-do list application to help you keep track of tasks and stay organized.

This project was a great learning experience and helped me get hands-on with Python programming. 
Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or just take a look at what Iâ€™ve built!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
